Hi there! My name is Olga, and I have a Master's degree in foreign languages.
While working in various jobs, I've come to realize that communication is key in everything we do. 
Looking towards the future, I have decided to learn how to communicate with computers 
by learning how to code and become a software developer.
Now I'm an aspiring developer trained in Full Stack Development at the School of Code. 
I bring a unique combination of technical know-how and communication skills with a caring attitude.
With hands-on experience and eagerness to learn, I am looking forward to a new career in tech.
